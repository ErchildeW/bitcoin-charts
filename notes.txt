Notes:
- onMouseMove callbacks use slightly different stuff for setting up index/xPos
- rename css class names to things like 'darkBlue', 'lightBlue', 'darkRed', 'lightRed', etc
- consolidate the estimates components

- To fix sqrt to log charts:
  - look for sqrtDaysPassed in chart-data.js and make a log version
  - look for xScale: scalePower in the chart components and change to
    scaleLog instead. (Domain cannot start with 0 in scaleLog.)
